Kivy Crash Course
=================

This repository contains material relating to my Kivy Crash Course youtube series, a set of (mostly) <10m videos walking users through the creation of a first kivy app, followed by a succession of changes and more advanced concepts to let the app use all of kivy's power.

Most video directories contain a few main files. The python is in `before.py` and `after.py`, containing the code at the start and end of the video respectively. You can download and run `before.py` to follow along with the tutorial, or download and run `after.py` to try the code after I've made the tutorial changes. Kv language definitions are in `tutorial.kv`, and if this changes through the video then the initial and final kv files will be `tutorial.kv_before` and `tutorial.kv_after` respectively. If using these, you'll need to rename them appropriately.

Some videos have an associated `notes.txt`, containing any notes I wrote to go with them or to help keep track of what I wanted to say.
